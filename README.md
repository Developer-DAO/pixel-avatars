# Derivatives Project

## Project
The Derivatives project, originally known as the pixel-avatars project is created initially to allow the minting of a derived Pixel Avatar ERC721 NFT token generated based on the traits of the original DeveloperDAO genesis NFTs. ; similar to how Loot has its own derivatives projects

It was later renamed to a derivatives project to include initiatives that will form a roadmap beyond the initial pixel avatars token.

## Historical notes
User by the name of Neoc id the DeveloperDao Discord was offering to do an avatar versions of the developer dao NFT genesis token. Another user [goldzulu](https://github.com/goldzulu) spotted the potential and suggested a project which upon some initial concensus was put to lead the project. Officially the project kicked off on the 12th September 2021 via an online discord meeting hosted by goldzulu.
## Areas Of Interest
There are three different areas in which devs can be actively involed in
### Backend
This is where solidity smart contracts are being planned, created, tested and deployed. It also covers IPFS, Oracles and generally, anything that is supporting the Web3 frontends

### Frontend
The web3 front end that will support users in minting, [previewing](./web-previewer/README.md) and other utilities and apps further down in the roadmap including possibly NFT Games and Metaverses.
### Graphics Design

Where the artwork design and generation is being done. Initially it will be a unique artwork "component" for each of the different possible traits.
